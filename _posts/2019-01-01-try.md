- hi there
- this is easy to use since no need to enter commands like latex.


$\sin x$

$\frac{1}{n}$

eh...


$\frac{1}{\pi}$, so...

\[\frac{1}{n}\]


rrrrrrrrr

\[
\begin{split}
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\exp(-\frac{t^2}{2})dt & = \sqrt{\gamma} \\
& = \cup A_n \\
& = \text{whatever}
\end{split}
\]
rrrrrrrrrfff

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\exp(-\frac{t^2}{2})dt
\]


but does this really work???
I hope so.
1. how are you?
